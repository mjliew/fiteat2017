 -Guide to installing/running the application
 To set up the environment:
 1. Install visual studion code(generally could be any other text editor, but here is the most powerful support of different add-ons)
 2. Install .less (https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/css)
 
 Guidelines:
 1. We use .less files to write css. The main file is styles.less, when you start develop a new page create a new file with clear naming and include it to styles.less
 2. For often repeated styles we use veriables which could be fined in veriables.less. For mediaqueries we also use veriables.
 3. Css classes should be clearly named and inherit it's parent name. For example conteiner with class "red" then its child will be "red-child".
 4.Take in the consideration the code structure. We use tab for indentation. 
 5. If you write the javascripr code veriables should have clear naming.
 
 To upload your changes in gh-pages brunch:
 1. Update gh-pages
 2. Resolve conflicts
 3. Push your changes with clear commit message. 
 4. All changes should be comited in the gh-pages branch.
